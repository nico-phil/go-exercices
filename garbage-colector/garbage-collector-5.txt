Dedicated Garbage Collection Threads and Work Stealing
    The Go runtime employs dedicated operating system (OS) threads for garbage collection tasks. 
    These threads operate independently of the Goroutines managed by the Go scheduler, meaning 
    they can run garbage collection concurrently with program execution, enhancing the overall 
    efficiency of the Go runtime. This approach capitalizes on multi-core processors, allowing 
    for parallel garbage collection.

    Work stealing is a strategy used by the garbage collector to optimize the distribution of 
    work across multiple processors. In work stealing, idle processors can “steal” tasks from 
    busy ones, effectively balancing the load across all available processors. This dynamic load 
    balancing helps Go achieve efficient utilization of computational resources and boosts the 
    performance of garbage collection. The work stealing algorithm has been designed to minimize c
    ontention and maximize parallelism, which leads to better CPU cache utilization and overall 
    hroughput.

    When a GC cycle starts, the Go runtime creates a set of tasks, each representing a section 
    of the heap that needs to be scanned. These tasks are stored in a global queue.
    When a processor is free, it pulls a task from this queue and starts executing it. 
    If another processor finishes its current task and finds the global queue empty, 
    it attempts to steal a task from another processor’s local queue. This mechanism 
    continues until all tasks have been completed, leading to the termination of the GC cycle.

    It’s noteworthy that Go’s garbage collector not only balances the work among processors 
    but also adapts to the workload. The garbage collector tracks the allocation rate and 
    the time taken to scan the heap. It uses this data to adjust the rate of object allocation, 
    allowing it to control the frequency and duration of GC cycles.

    This clever use of dedicated garbage collection threads and work stealing contribute 
    to the minimal GC pause times in Go, one of the garbage collector’s key objectives. 
    This efficient utilization of resources enhances the overall performance of Go applications, 
    especially in multi-core, multi-processor environments. The following sections will further
    explore heap partitioning and other optimizations that contribute to Go’s robust garbage collection mechanism.

Heap Partitioning and Coloring
    To optimize the garbage collection process and better manage the memory, Go utilizes a 
    heap partitioning scheme. The heap is divided into several small blocks or spans, and 
    each span is usually of a particular size class. These spans are the smallest units of 
    memory that the garbage collector deals with. All objects of a particular size are allocated 
    from the same span, which reduces fragmentation and increases memory utilization.

    This partitioning scheme makes the garbage collector’s job easier and more efficient. 
    Since each span consists of objects of the same size, the garbage collector doesn’t need 
    to traverse the entire heap; it can simply scan the spans containing live objects.

    To further improve the garbage collection process, Go uses a tri-color marking scheme, 
    which we’ve discussed earlier. To recap, the heap is conceptually divided into three 
    sets or “colors”:

    White: Objects that have not been visited yet.
    Grey: Objects that have been visited but whose children have not been visited.
    Black: Objects that have been visited and whose children have been visited.
    At the start of the garbage collection cycle, all objects are white. 
    The garbage collector visits each object, starting from the root, and colors it grey. 
    Then it visits the children of the grey objects and colors them grey, while the parent 
    objects are turned black. This process continues until there are no more grey objects, 
    at which point all reachable objects will be black, and all unreachable objects will 
    be white. The white objects are then considered garbage and reclaimed by the garbage 
    collector.

    This mechanism allows the garbage collector to work concurrently with the program execution, 
    reducing pause times and making the garbage collection process more efficient. 
    In the next section, we will explore how Go achieves efficient garbage collection 
    through the concept of write barriers.
