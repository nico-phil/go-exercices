in Go, strings are stored as two part structure in memory

    1. pointer to the actual string data(which resides in a separate block of memory).
    2. Length of the string, representing the number of bytes in the string (not necessarily the number of characters).


This structure allows strings in Go to be efficiently passed around by reference 
(since only the pointer and length are passed, not the entire data). However, strings 
in Go are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be modified.
