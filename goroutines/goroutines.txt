Goroutines

-   goroutine are  ligth-weight thread manage by the go runtime

-   goroutine creation is faster than thread creation, because you are not creating operating system-level
    resourses

-   Goroutine initial stack sizes are smaller than thread stack sizes and can grow as needed. This make
    gorutine more memory efficient

-   switching between goroutines are faster than switching between thread because it happens intirely 
    within the process, avoiding operation system calls that are relatively slow
